# Resume
This is a repo to keep track of my resume and its different versions.

- `resume.md` is written in markdown.
- `resume.html` is created using "Markdown All in One" extension for VS Code.
- Add `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">` to the head of `resume.html` to apply styles from the `styles.css` file. Place this right under the `<title>` tag.
- `Olin Kirkland.pdf` is created by printing to PDF after opening `resume.html` in Chrome.

## Update 6/24/2025
- Updated the resume to reflect my current position at Br√ºck Electronic GmbH and added new skills and proficiencies.
- Removed phone number and changed location for move to New Baltimore.

## Update 11/29/2022
- Added German translation of resume, `resume-de.md` and replaced `resume.md` with English version (`resume-en.md`).
