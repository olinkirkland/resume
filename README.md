# Resume
This is a repo to keep track of my resume and its different versions.

- `resume.md` is written in markdown.
- `resume.html` is created using "Markdown All in One" extension for VS Code
- `Olin Kirkland.pdf` is created by printing to PDF after opening resume.html in Chrome

## Update 11/29/2022
- Added German translation of resume, `resume-de.md` and replaced `resume.md` with English version (`resume-en.md`)
