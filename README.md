# Resume
This is a repo to keep track of my resume and its different versions.

- `resume.md` is written in markdown.
- `resume.html` is created by running the `scripts/parse-markdown.js` script. While running, every five seconds it will convert all markdown files in the `markdown/` directory to HTML and place the output in the `html/` directory. The output uses the `styles.css` file for styling.
- `Olin Kirkland.pdf` is created by printing to PDF after opening `resume.html` in Chrome.

## Update 6/25/2025
- Reorganized the repository and added my own markdown parser script to convert markdown files to HTML, in order to keep styling consistent and not rely on the VSCode markdown addon.

## Update 6/24/2025
- Updated the resume to reflect my current position at Br√ºck Electronic GmbH and added new skills and proficiencies.
- Removed phone number and changed location for move to New Baltimore.

## Update 11/29/2022
- Added German translation of resume, `resume-de.md` and replaced `resume.md` with English version (`resume-en.md`).
